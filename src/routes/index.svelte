<h1 class="mb-4">Hi! I'm Philip, and I'm a web developer</h1>

<p>I'm from Denmark, but currently I live in Czech Republic with my girlfriend to experience life abroad and learn from the talented people I get to work with here.</p>

<div class="flex gap-20 flex-col lg:flex-row items-center lg:items-stretch">

	<p>I'm a JavaScript/TypeScript software developer who focuses on front-end frameworks such as Reacrt and Svelte. I have a passion for Web Accessibility and preferment applications.
		I have experience working large and complex React web applications that require cross-team collaboration and global state management (Redux) in Agile and Kanban settings. I've also worked on smaller web applications such as admin dashboards and user forms.
		I also develop back-end services done in NodeJS and making scripts for automating tasks. I'm not afraid to take on a hard challenge and dive into unknown territory.</p>
