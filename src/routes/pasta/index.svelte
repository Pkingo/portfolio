	<h1>Copy/Paste üçù</h1>
	<p>This is a collection of code snippet that I find myself use often or code snippet that I find neat. These snippets are not "novice" but code I often find myself thinking "how is it you do that thing" or small code snippet that is done in a cool/inspiring way. I often copy code from here, feel free to do the same</p>
	<br />
	<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: I have not written all of these code snippet myself, but often found some code online that I developed further and decide to keep, so that I could easily find them agani</p>
